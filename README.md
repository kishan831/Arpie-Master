**Arpie** is a musical toy app made with [Unity]. You can add bouncing balls by
tapping (or clicking) the screen. Balls hit the cubes on the bottom of the
screen and play notes assigned to each of them. It allows you to create
melodies (or arpeggios) without requiring any musical experience or knowledge.
